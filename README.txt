When learning a language people develop common sense and grammar rules to know how to make effective sentences. This
is something that's difficult to teach a computer, especially at this level of simplicity. We can tell when something
doesn't sound exactly right and we are able to fix that with something else that just sounds right. This program acts
more like a parrot, it can't understand what its trying to say, its just copying what it saw someone else do. Some poems
sound a little better than other ones, I think its because some of them are shorter and its more limited to the options
to choose from with the next word. Having fewer options to choose from its more likely to stay on topic and make better
sounding sentences. Also, adding in punctuation and capitalization would help a bit.
